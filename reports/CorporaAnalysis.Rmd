## Executive Summary

bla-bla

## Data
Dataset, provided by SwiftKey, contains four languages with three files in each one: news, blogs and Twitter feeds. In my project I work with English texts only. Three files in total are about 570 MB.
In detail:

```{r}
library(stringi)
setwd("..")
dirPath <- "data/final/en_US/"
filesList <- paste0(dirPath, dir(dirPath))
df <- data.frame()
for (f in filesList) {
  fileSize <- round(file.size(f) / 10^6)
  fileIn <- file(f, "r")
  inData <- readLines(fileIn, skipNul = TRUE)
  numLines <- round(length(inData) / 10^6, digits = 2)
  numWords <-  round(stri_count_words(inData) / 10^6, digits = 2)
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(file = f,
                             size.MB = fileSize,
                             lines.M = numLines,
                             words.M = numWords))
  close(fileIn)
}
(df)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
